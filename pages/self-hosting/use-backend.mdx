# Configure your client with the backend

If you would like to use an alternative backend server (the server responsible for saving user data across devices) then you can specify your own URL **without needing to host your own P-Stream frontend!**

<Caution>
  Changing your backend server will log you out of your account - make sure you
  have a copy of your 12-word passphrase saved in case you need to go back!
