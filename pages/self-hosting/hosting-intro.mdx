<Note>

</Note>

Since P-Stream has many different components, there are a few configurations of how you can host it. Each of these configurations has their own benefits, whether that be having complete control over your data or customizing your experience.
**If you don't know what to choose, go with [method 1.](#method-1-only-host-the-frontend)**

---

## Method 1 - Only host the frontend

With this method, you only host the essential parts that make P-Stream work. But keep using the account server from official P-Stream.
This method is the easiest to self-host and is recommended for most users.

1. [Set up the Proxy!](../proxy/deploy.mdx)
2. [Set up the Client!](../client/deploy.mdx)

---

## Method 2 - Only host the account server

If you want to own your own data, it's possible to self-host just the account server and nothing else.
This method is only recommended if you have experience hosting databases or other similar stateful applications.

1. [Set up the Backend!](../backend/deploy.mdx)
2. [Configure the Client!](../client/deploy.mdx)

---

## Method 3 - Host everything

If you want an instance that's completely isolated from the official P-Stream. You can self-host all of the parts yourself, though this method is not recommended for inexperienced hosters.

1. [Set up the Proxy!](../proxy/deploy.mdx)
2. [Set up the Backend!](../backend/deploy.mdx)
3. [Set up the Client!](../client/deploy.mdx)
