# Guide to Self-Deployment with Docker Compose

<Steps>
  <Steps.Step>
    **Install Docker and Docker Compose:**
   
    Ensure that Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system. You can follow the official Docker documentation for installation instructions:
    - [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
  </Steps.Step>

  <Steps.Step>
    **Create a Docker Compose file:**

    Create a new file named `docker-compose.yml` in your project directory and paste the following content into it:

    ```yaml
    version: '3.8'

    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres
        restart: unless-stopped
        environment:
          POSTGRES_USER: movie_web_user
          POSTGRES_DB: movie_web_backend
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: YourPasswordHere
        networks:
          - p-stream-network

      p-stream-backend:
        image: ghcr.io/p-stream/backend:latest
        restart: unless-stopped
        environment:
          MWB_SERVER__CORS: "https://movie-backend.example.tld https://movie.example.tld"
          MWB_SERVER__PORT: 8080
          MWB_POSTGRES__CONNECTION: postgresql://movie_web_user:YourPasswordHere@postgres:5432/movie_web_backend
          MWB_CRYPTO__SESSION_SECRET: 32CHARACTERLONGSECRET
          MWB_META__NAME: Server name
          MWB_META__DESCRIPTION: Server Description
          MWB_POSTGRES__MIGRATE_ON_BOOT: "true"
          MWB_SERVER__TRUSTPROXY: "true"
          MWB_SERVER__TRUSTCLOUDFLARE: "true"
          # This is needed to resolve errors running migrations on some platforms - does not affect the application
          MIKRO_ORM_MIGRATIONS_DISABLE_FOREIGN_KEYS: "false"
        ports:
          - "8080:8080"
        depends_on:
          - postgres
        networks:
          - p-stream-network

      p-stream-frontend:
        build:
          context: https://github.com/p-stream/p-stream.git
          args:
            TMDB_READ_API_KEY: "YourTMDBReadAPIKeyHere"
            CORS_PROXY_URL: "https://cors.example.tld https://second.cors.example.tld"
            BACKEND_URL: "https://backend.example.tld"
            DMCA_EMAIL: "YourEmail"
            PWA_ENABLED: "true"
            APP_DOMAIN: "YourDomainHere"
            OPENSEARCH_ENABLED: "true"
            GA_ID: "Google ID Here"
        ports:
          - "80:80"
        networks:
          - p-stream-network
        restart: unless-stopped

      p-stream-proxy:
        image: ghcr.io/p-stream/simple-proxy:latest
        ports:
          - "3000:3000"
        networks:
          - p-stream-network
        restart: unless-stopped

    networks:
      p-stream-network:
        driver: bridge
    ```
    **Important:**
    * Replace `YourPasswordHere` with your secure database password.
    * Generate a strong session secret and replace `32CharacterLongStringHere`.
    * Replace `TMDBReadAPIKey` with your api key learn more [here](../client/tmdb.mdx).
    * replace `yourDomainHere` with whatever you'll be using to access your main site, like pstream.org
    * replace `meta__name` and `meta__description`

  </Steps.Step>

  <Steps.Step>
    **Start the Backend:**  Open a terminal in the directory containing `docker-compose.yml` and execute:

    ```bash
    docker compose up --detach
    ```

  </Steps.Step>
</Steps>
### Accessing Your Backend

Your services should be accessible on `(YourPrivateIP):port`. To share it outside your local network, you'll need to configure port forwarding or cloudflared tunnel.

### Optional: Implementing a Reverse Proxy

To enhance your SSL and domain configuration, it's advisable to establish a reverse proxy, such as Nginx. For an optimal choice in this regard, Cloudflare Zero Trust Tunnel is recommended. You can find more information [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/create-remote-tunnel/).
