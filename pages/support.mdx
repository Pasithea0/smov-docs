# Support

We provide support to users and hosters in our discord server. Though we have some rules about the questions you can ask.

<Frame>
  1. No questions about NSBX. (unless of course it doesn't work)
  2. Don't ask to be put on the [instances list](/instances)
  3. No asking developers to help you code
  4. No duplicate tickets

<Note>
  Only ask questions in designated support tickets, otherwise they will most
  likely not be seen or answered seriously.
</Note>
